## Welcome to the Course

This course explores the strategic and technical dimensions of AI and data transformation specifically within the Food & Beverage industry. Over five sessions, we'll move from foundational enabling technologies through to the human and organizational dimensions of data-driven transformation.

## Course Structure

The course is organized into **five lectures**:

1. **Enabling Technologies** - The technical foundations of AI and data systems
2. **Info-Economy & Data Value** - Understanding data as a strategic asset
3. **Analytics-Driven Strategy** - Building competitive advantage through analytics
4. **Machine Learning Applications** - Practical ML implementation in F&B
5. **Human Dimension** - Organizational change, ethics, and governance

Each lecture combines theoretical frameworks with practical applications drawn from real Food & Beverage industry contexts.

## Learning Approach

This course emphasizes:

- **Industry-specific applications** connecting concepts to F&B business challenges
- **Interactive simulations and exercises** to apply learning in practice
- **AI-powered learning support** through dedicated assistants for content, practice, and teaching
- **Strategic and technical balance** addressing both the "why" and "how" of AI deployment

## Getting Started

Begin by exploring the lecture materials, engaging with the AI assistants, and approaching each session with curiosity about how these concepts apply to your specific industry interests.

The transformation from traditional business operations to AI-enabled organizations requires both technical understanding and strategic vision. This course aims to equip you with both.

## Key Questions

1. **Explain the course's pedagogical approach and how it differs from traditional technical AI courses.** Why is the F&B industry focus strategically important, and how does the integration of business strategy with technical implementation create value beyond either dimension alone?

2. **Analyze the interconnections between the five lectures.** How do enabling technologies (Lecture 1) create the foundation for data value (Lecture 2), which informs analytics strategy (Lecture 3), enables machine learning applications (Lecture 4), and requires consideration of human and ethical dimensions (Lecture 5)? Provide a concrete F&B transformation scenario that illustrates this progression.

3. **Evaluate the role of AI assistants in the learning process for this course.** How does the three-tiered assistant structure (content support, structured exercises, teach-to-learn) reflect principles of effective learning? What are the limitations of AI-supported learning, and how should students balance AI assistance with independent critical thinking?

4. **Compare the challenges of AI adoption in the F&B industry versus more digitally-native sectors (e.g., tech, finance).** What industry-specific barriers exist (regulatory, cultural, technical), and what unique opportunities does the F&B sector present for AI-driven transformation?

5. **Synthesize the learning objectives across all five lectures to propose a strategic framework for AI transformation in an F&B organization.** What sequence of capabilities should be developed? Which organizational prerequisites are necessary before technical implementation begins? How would you measure success at each stage?
