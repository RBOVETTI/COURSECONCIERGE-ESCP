## Welcome to the Course

This course explores the strategic and technical dimensions of AI and data transformation specifically within the Food & Beverage industry. Over five sessions, we'll move from foundational enabling technologies through to the human and organizational dimensions of data-driven transformation.

## Course Structure

The course is organized into **five lectures**:

1. **Enabling Technologies** - The technical foundations of AI and data systems
2. **Info-Economy & Data Value** - Understanding data as a strategic asset
3. **Analytics-Driven Strategy** - Building competitive advantage through analytics
4. **Machine Learning Applications** - Practical ML implementation in F&B
5. **Human Dimension** - Organizational change, ethics, and governance

Each lecture combines theoretical frameworks with practical applications drawn from real Food & Beverage industry contexts.

## Learning Approach

This course emphasizes:

- **Industry-specific applications** connecting concepts to F&B business challenges
- **Interactive simulations and exercises** to apply learning in practice
- **AI-powered learning support** through dedicated assistants for content, practice, and teaching
- **Strategic and technical balance** addressing both the "why" and "how" of AI deployment

## Getting Started

Begin by exploring the lecture materials, engaging with the AI assistants, and approaching each session with curiosity about how these concepts apply to your specific industry interests.

The transformation from traditional business operations to AI-enabled organizations requires both technical understanding and strategic vision. This course aims to equip you with both.
