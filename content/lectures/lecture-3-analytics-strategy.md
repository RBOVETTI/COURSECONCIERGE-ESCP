## 1. Session Overview

This session is structured as a hands-on simulation exercise. Rather than a traditional lecture, you will engage directly with a business scenario designed to test and develop your analytics strategy skills in real time.

### The Harvard Business School Simulation

We will use the **"Data Analytics Simulation: Strategic Decision Making"** developed by **Thomas H. Davenport** for Harvard Business School Publishing. This simulation places participants in the role of decision-makers who must leverage data and analytics to drive business outcomes.

**Reference:** [HBS Case 7050 - Data Analytics Simulation: Strategic Decision Making](https://hbsp.harvard.edu/product/7050-HTM-ENG)

### What to Expect

- **Duration:** The full session (180 minutes) will be dedicated to the simulation and subsequent discussion
- **Format:** Team-based exercise followed by class-wide debrief
- **Objective:** Bridge the gap between theoretical analytics knowledge (from Lectures 1 and 2) and practical strategic application

## 2. Preparing for the Simulation

### Key Concepts to Review

Before the simulation, ensure you are comfortable with the following concepts from previous lectures:

**From the Course Introduction:**
- The Productivity Paradox and its implications for technology adoption
- The difference between prediction and clustering approaches

**From Lecture 1 (Enabling Technologies):**
- How cloud computing, IoT, and big data infrastructure enable analytics
- The gap between technology investment and effective deployment

**From Lecture 2 (Info-Economy):**
- The analytics spectrum: descriptive, predictive, and prescriptive
- The knowledge pyramid: from data to information to knowledge to decisions
- The 5 Vs of Big Data and their business implications

### Mindset for the Simulation

1. **Think strategically, not technically:** The simulation tests your ability to make sound business decisions with data, not your technical skills
2. **Prioritize under constraints:** You will have limited time and resources — learn to focus on high-impact analyses
3. **Communicate clearly:** Your analytical insights are only valuable if they can be translated into actionable recommendations
4. **Embrace uncertainty:** Real-world data is messy, incomplete, and ambiguous — the simulation reflects this reality

## 3. Learning Objectives for the Simulation

Through this exercise, you will develop practical skills in:

### Strategic Analytics Decision-Making
- How to identify which business questions are worth answering with data
- How to allocate analytical resources across competing priorities
- How to balance speed and rigor in time-pressured environments

### Organizational Readiness
- Understanding the human and organizational factors that determine analytics success
- Recognizing that technology alone does not drive transformation
- Appreciating the role of leadership commitment and cultural alignment

### From Insight to Action
- Translating analytical findings into concrete business recommendations
- Presenting data-driven arguments to non-technical stakeholders
- Making decisions with imperfect information

## 4. Post-Simulation Discussion Framework

After completing the simulation, we will debrief as a class using the following guiding questions:

### Reflection on Process
- What was your team's decision-making process? How did you prioritize?
- Where did you feel most confident in your decisions? Where most uncertain?
- How did time pressure affect the quality of your analysis?

### Reflection on Outcomes
- Which decisions had the greatest impact on your results?
- Were there decisions that seemed right analytically but failed in practice? Why?
- How did organizational factors (team dynamics, communication, alignment) influence outcomes?

### Connection to Course Themes
- How does the simulation experience relate to the Productivity Paradox discussed in the Course Introduction?
- What role did the analytics spectrum (descriptive → predictive → prescriptive) play in your approach?
- What insights about data-driven culture emerged from the team exercise?

## Key Takeaways

1. **Strategy Precedes Technology:** The most successful analytics initiatives start with clear business questions, not sophisticated algorithms.

2. **Prioritization Is Essential:** Organizations cannot analyze everything. Focusing analytical resources on high-impact, strategically aligned questions is a core leadership skill.

3. **The Human Element Matters:** Team dynamics, communication, and leadership alignment are as important as data quality and analytical sophistication.

4. **Imperfect Action Beats Perfect Analysis:** In time-pressured business environments, making reasoned decisions with available data outperforms waiting for complete information.

5. **Organizational Readiness Determines Success:** Analytics capabilities must be matched by organizational willingness and ability to act on insights.

6. **Learning by Doing:** Simulation-based learning reveals blind spots and builds practical skills that lectures alone cannot develop.

## Discussion Prompts

1. Reflect on your simulation experience: What was the most surprising insight about your own decision-making process? How would you approach the simulation differently with hindsight?

2. Consider a real business context you are familiar with. How would you apply the lessons from the simulation to improve analytics-driven decision making in that organization?

3. The simulation forced trade-offs between speed and analytical rigor. In your professional experience, how do organizations typically handle this tension? What best practices have you observed?
